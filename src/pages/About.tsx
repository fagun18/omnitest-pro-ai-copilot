            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              OmniTest was founded in 2023 by a team of experienced software testing professionals who recognized a critical gap in the market: as web applications grew increasingly complex, traditional testing methods struggled to keep pace, resulting in missed bugs and quality issues.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Our founders experienced firsthand the challenges of maintaining comprehensive test coverage while under pressure to deliver faster. They envisioned a solution that would leverage artificial intelligence to augment human testers, making them more effective and efficient.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              After months of research and development, OmniTest was born â€” an AI-powered testing co-pilot that automatically detects web application components and provides intelligent testing suggestions. Today, we're proud to help hundreds of companies deliver higher quality software by ensuring nothing slips through the cracks.
